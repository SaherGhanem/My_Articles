<h1 align="center"> "ASIL" (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) and "QM" (Quality Management) </h1>

<h2 align="left"> This terms are used in the context of automotive safety standards, particularly in ISO 26262, which is a standard for functional safety in road vehicles.</h2>

<h3 align="left">Here's how they differ:</h3>

<h3 align= "left"> 1. ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level):</h3>
<h4 align= "left">1) Purpose: ASIL is a risk classification scheme defined by ISO 26262. It determines the necessary safety requirements to reduce risk in automotive systems to an acceptable level.</h4>

<h4 align= "left"> 2) Levels: There are four ASIL levels, ranging from A to D, where: </h4>
<h4 align= "left"> ----> ASIL A: Lowest safety level. </h4>
<h4 align= "left"> ----> ASIL D: Highest safety level, requiring the most stringent safety measures. </h4>
<h4 align= "left"> 3) Assessment: The ASIL level is determined based on three factors:</h4>
<h4 align= "left"> ----> Severity: The potential impact of a failure on the vehicle's occupants and others (e.g., pedestrians). </h4>
<h4 align= "left"> ----> Exposure: The probability of the vehicle being in a situation where the failure could occur.</h4>
<h4 align= "left"> ----> Controllability: The ability of the driver to control the vehicle if the failure occurs.</h4>

<h3 align= "left"> 2. QM (Quality Management):</h3>
<h4 align= "left"> 1) Purpose: QM refers to the processes and practices involved in ensuring that the product or system meets defined quality standards. In ISO 26262, "QM" indicates that no specific safety requirements are necessary beyond standard quality management processes. </h4>
<h4 align= "left"> 2) Role in ISO 26262: QM is applied to systems or components that do not have a significant impact on vehicle safety. If a component is classified as QM, it means that standard quality management processes are sufficient, and there is no need for additional safety measures. </h4>

<h3 align="left"> Key Differences: </h3>
<h4 align="left"> 1) Focus: ASIL focuses on the safety aspect of automotive systems, whereas QM focuses on the overall quality management process. </h4>
<h4 align="left"> 2) Application: ASIL applies to components or systems that have a direct impact on vehicle safety, while QM applies to those that do not pose significant safety risks. </h4>
<h4 align="left"> 3) Stringency: ASIL involves more rigorous safety requirements as the level increases, while QM follows standard quality assurance procedures without additional safety-related requirements. </h4>

<h3 align="left"> In summary, ASIL levels are used to categorize and address safety risks in automotive systems, while QM represents standard quality management processes used when safety-related risks are not a concern.</h3>
